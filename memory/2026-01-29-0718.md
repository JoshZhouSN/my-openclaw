## Conversation Summary

assistant: I notice that `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` is not in the current PATH. This means the Linuxbrew installation isn't properly integrated with the shell environment. Let me check where the actual node binary from Linuxbrew is:


assistant: Let me check the actual Cellar location:


assistant: Now I understand the situation! The Linuxbrew installation is there with Node.js 25.5.0 in the Cellar, but it's not in the PATH. However, we also have Node.js v24.13.0 in `/usr/bin/node`. Let me check if that's also from Linuxbrew:


assistant: That's very interesting! We actually have two different Node.js installations:

1. **System Node.js** (v24.13.0) at `/usr/bin/node` - This is likely installed via a NodeSource repository (given the large file size of 121MB)
2. **Linuxbrew Node.js** (v25.5.0) at `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/node` - This is the one installed via Linuxbrew

Let me check if there's a way these are connected:


assistant: Perfect! Now I understand the complete picture:

1. **Node.js v24.13.0** was installed via APT from the NodeSource repository (as evidenced by the `nodejs` package managing `/usr/bin/node`)
2. **Node.js v25.5.0** was installed separately via Linuxbrew 
3. Linuxbrew is installed at `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` but its bin directory is not in the PATH

So we have both package managers with Node.js installed. The system is currently using the APT-installed version (v24.13.0) since it's in the PATH, but the Linuxbrew version (v25.5.0) is also available.

This explains why earlier we didn't notice the Linuxbrew installation - because the system was using the APT version instead.

assistant: 好的，我来删除 Linuxbrew 及其安装的 Node.js。首先，让我卸载 Linuxbrew 中安装的 Node.js，然后移除整个 Linuxbrew 安装：


assistant: Great! It looks like the uninstallation removed not just Node.js but many other packages that were installed via Linuxbrew. Now let me completely remove the Linuxbrew installation:


assistant: The directory is owned by root, so I need to use sudo:


assistant: Good! Now let me verify that Linuxbrew has been completely removed:


assistant: Perfect! The Linuxbrew installation has been completely removed. Now let me verify that we still have the system Node.js available:


assistant: Excellent! I have successfully:

1. **Removed Linuxbrew and all its installed packages** - The entire `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` directory has been deleted
2. **Confirmed that system Node.js remains intact** - Node.js v24.13.0 is still available from the original APT installation
3. **Eliminated potential conflicts** - Now there's only one Node.js installation to manage

The system is now cleaner with just the APT-installed Node.js (v24.13.0), which we've confirmed is working properly. This eliminates the confusion between multiple Node.js installations and simplifies system management going forward.

assistant: Let me double-check if there were any other packages installed via Linuxbrew besides Node.js. Since we already uninstalled the entire Linuxbrew directory, let me verify what was installed by checking the original installation records if any exist:


assistant: Based on my checks:

1. **The `brew` command no longer exists** - Linuxbrew has been completely removed
2. **Only the APT-installed Node.js remains** - Only the `nodejs` package from the NodeSource repository is installed
3. **No symlinks to Linuxbrew exist** - No traces of Linuxbrew packages in system paths

When we ran the uninstall command earlier, it showed that the Linuxbrew uninstallation process removed many packages (like brotli, berkeley-db@5, bzip2, c-ares, etc.), but the main package we were concerned about was Node.js.

Now the system only has the APT-installed Node.js (v24.13.0) from the NodeSource repository, which is working correctly. So yes, after removing Linuxbrew, there are no other packages from it remaining on the system.
